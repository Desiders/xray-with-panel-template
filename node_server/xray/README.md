## Purpose

This file serves as a baseline XRay configuration that you can customize to fit your specific needs. Once modified, this file is intended to be uploaded or specified within the Remnawave Panel's graphical user interface (GUI). The Panel will then provision this configuration to the specified nodes, allowing them to operate with your custom XRay settings.

## Usage

Before using this template, you **must** modify placeholders.

After you have customized `config.jsonc` with your specific paths and domain, you will typically upload or paste its content into the Remnawave Panel's configuration interface. The Panel then handles the deployment of this customized XRay configuration to your nodes.
