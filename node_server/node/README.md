# Remnawave Node

This directory contains the configuration for the Remnawave Node service.

## Configuration

The service is configured through environment variables defined in an `.env` file. A template for this file is provided as `.env.template`.

### `.env` file

You need to create a `.env` file in this directory with the following variables:

- **`SECRET_KEY`**: This is a secret key that should be generated by the panel.
- **`NODE_PORT`**: The port on which the Remnawave node service will listen. It defaults to `2222` if not specified in the `.env` file.

### `docker-compose.yaml`

The `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the `remnanode` service. Key configurations include:

- **Image**: `remnawave/node:latest`
- **Network**: Uses `host` network mode.
- **Port**: The node runs on the port defined by the `NODE_PORT` environment variable (default `2222`).
- **SSL Certificates**: The service mounts SSL certificates from `/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{DOMAIN}}/`. You need to replace `{{DOMAIN}}` with your actual domain name. These certificates are expected to be generated, for example, by Certbot.

## Running the Service

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.template` and add the `SECRET_KEY` provided by the panel and the desired `NODE_PORT`.
2. Replace `{{DOMAIN}}` in `docker-compose.yaml` with your domain.
3. Make sure you have valid SSL certificates at the specified paths.
4. Run the service using `docker-compose up -d`.
