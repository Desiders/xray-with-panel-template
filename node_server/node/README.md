## Configuration

### `.env` file

You need to create a `.env` file in this directory with the following variables:

- **`SECRET_KEY`**: This is a secret key that should be generated by the panel.
- **`NODE_PORT`**: The port on which the Remnawave node service will listen. It defaults to `2222` if not specified in the `.env` file.
