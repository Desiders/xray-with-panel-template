# Configuration

### `conf.d` Directory

- **`panel.conf`**: Configures the Nginx server for the main panel application;
- **`subscription.conf`**: Configures the Nginx server for the subscription page.

## Usage

**Important:** The current configuration uses relative paths and is provided as an example. For a production environment, you should modify the configurations to use absolute paths for volumes and included files to ensure stability and prevent path-related issues. You should also replace placeholder variables with your actual hostnames.
