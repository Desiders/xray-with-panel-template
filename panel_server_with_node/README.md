# Panel Server with Node

This directory contains a combined setup for deploying both the **Panel Server** and the **Node Server** on a single machine. It includes all the necessary services from both `panel_server` and `node_server` directories.

## Overview

This setup is designed for users who want to run all components of the Remnawave system on one server. It includes the Remnawave Panel, the database, Redis, the subscription page, the Remnawave Node, Anubis, and a combined Nginx configuration.

## Documentation

Please refer to these `README.md` files for detailed information on how to configure each component. The general principles for configuration (e.g., using `.env` files) remain the same as in the separate `node_server` and `panel_server` setups.
